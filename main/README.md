## GitHub Developer Submission Procedure
Assuming the [Team FTA GitHub repo](https://github.com/UTMCSC301/project-full-throttle-axolotl.git) has been cloned to your machine:

1. Move all new/updated deliverable files into the appropriate folder in your local repo clone
2. Create a new GitHub branch named with this convention: [s#]-[name]-[FUL-#]

    a. **[s#]**: Current Sprint #

    b. **[name]**: Your own name; lowercase
    
    c. **[FUL-#]**: The Jira issue for which you are submitting changes
    
    _(e.g. A branch from Gordon for Sprint 1 would look like_ **s1-gordon-FUL-0**_)_

3. Move your local changes over to the branch you just created
4. Write your Jira ticket number in the summary with a basic description (e.g. "[FUL-XX] Updated ../main/README.md")
5. Write a meaningful description of what is accomplished in your changes
    - Bullet point form is fine; use “~” to separate each main detail
6. Fetch the latest origin and merge any conflicting files if necessary
7. Commit your changes to your new branch
8. Publish your branch to the [project-full-throttle-axolotl repo](https://github.com/UTMCSC301/project-full-throttle-axolotl.git)
9. From there, create a pull request for your new branch
10. Merge the pull request into the master branch
11. Once you are certain your work on your Jira ticket is complete, then safely delete your branch.

[Take a look at this example commit made for reference](https://github.com/UTMCSC301/project-full-throttle-axolotl/commit/f1440740c1be42800cdd1e85d1000534c0b0bdfc).

When you merge, make triple-sure that your code works and you don’t include anything you don’t mean to.

And above all…

## ***DON’T BREAK THE BUILD!***
