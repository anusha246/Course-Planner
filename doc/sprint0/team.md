**Methods of Communication**

We will mainly communicate in a team group chat on Facebook Messenger, and sometimes through UofT email.

**Communication Response Times**

On Facebook Messenger: Within 1 hour (on average); 1 day (maximum)

By Email: Within 3 hours (on average); 1 day (maximum)

**Standup/Agile Meeting**

- Book a MN/DH study room and hold meetings there
- Each team member highlights what they did, problems they face, and what they will do before the next meeting
- The entire meeting will take a maximum of 15 minutes
- Mondays and Thursdays
- Occasional video chat meetings

**Meeting Preparation**

- Little preparation needed
- Bring laptop 
- Be on time
- For presentations, make sure demo is functioning and slides are ready beforehand

**Version Control**

- Comment and document code well 
- Make atomic commits
- Big merges in group meetings
- Use descriptive commit messages highlighting what you changed (new additions / fixed specific bug or case)
- Do not be vague with commit messages
- Do not commit code that does not compile 

**Roles and Division of Work**

- Divide work tasks based on proficiency, complexity, and estimated time to complete
- Make work division decisions as a team

**Submitting Sprint Deliverables and Software**

- Anusha will submit documents and files at least 4 hours before the deadline
- Venura will review submissions to make sure they are complete and correct
- The team will push code to the repos

**Contingency Planning**

- If a teammate drops the course, have an emergency group meeting to redivide their work
- If a teammate misses meetings, contact them online to understand why:
  - If they cannot make the meetings for a valid reason, reschedule meetings or hold online meetings
  - If they do not have a valid reason, for example, if they do not come because they do not want to, discuss the matter with the team member by email to maintain a record of the conversation. Then, if they do not attend the next meeting, hold an emergency team meeting to discuss the matter and notify the professor and TA
- If a teammate is not meeting deadlines, investigation is necessary:
  - Nothing was done: discuss the issue with the team member through email to maintain a record of the conversation. If they do not meet deadlines after that, hold an emergency team meeting to consider dropping the member
  - They need help: help them if you are done with your tasks
  - Task is harder than originally discussed, we can:
    - Assign the teammate another task instead
    - Redistribute workload in the next sprint
    - Remove the task if unnecessary / cannot allocate resources to finish it
- If a teammate is academically dishonest, we will have an emergency team discussion and discuss the matters with the professor and TA
- Have references to all code seen online on a Google document and if unsure, bring it up to team during a meeting, still record just in case; better to be safe than sorry
- We plan to be communicative with each other to avoid these situations
