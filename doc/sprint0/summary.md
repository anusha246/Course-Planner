# Summary - Course Planner
**Executive Summary**

Team FULL THROTTLE AXOLOTL is creating a no-nonsense Course Planner. The Course Planner is a web-based application that tracks and arranges a user’s proposed academic career for personal and professional use. It provides its users with a streamlined, easy-to-understand scheduling system that keeps all their prospective education organized and ready to be adjusted if needed.

The Course Planner’s key users are students looking for a universal guidance tool to help them plan out their academic career. It aims to help students and student-associated people of all descriptions; like new students looking to organize their existing courses; student TAs needing to see courses they will teach on the same timetable as their own courses; and students who want to view their path to graduation and ensure they have met the necessary requirements.

The members of Team FULL THROTTLE AXOLOTL keep an open line of communication with one another at all times for regular updates of everyone’s work progress. The team typically uses utoronto email threads, Microsoft Teams services, WhatsApp group chats, and, of course, weekly in-person meetings. To facilitate a smoother working experience with one another, everyone follows these basic tenets: attend all meetings on time; help in decision making and proposing ideas clearly; have at least one person review a pull request before merging branches; and never plagiarize.
