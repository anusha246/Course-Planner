# **Process**
* The team was organized using messaging apps like Messenger, WhatsApp and Outlook email. Each member of the team was then assigned certain parts of sprint 0 deliverables to do depending on the team’s voting system. The sprint 0 deliverable roles were decided as the following:
   * summary.md: Gordon
   * competition.md: Aaron
   * Personas.pdf: Anusha, Nabeel
   * Product Backlog: Everyone --(converting to markdown)--> PB.md: Gordon
   * User Interface: Venura
   * done.md: Azan
   * process.md: Rohan
* The team met in person every Monday of the week in a room at MN from 3pm to 4pm where we planned and decided on our project topic.
* The decision making for the team was based on a voting system: 
    * First, each of us presented our ideas/suggestions to the team at the group meeting.
    * Next, the team voted to decide whether or not to follow that idea/suggestion.
* We defined the point system for our user stories using the basic 1-10 scale based on the difficulty and length of the user story. The 10 point system was decided to be used by the team, after voting with other point systems such as Fibonacci and powers of 2. The 10 point system that the team decided is used as follows:
    * Each team member first rated each user story based between 1-10. The results were stored in a table containing all the team member name and the points that they gave for each user story.
    *  There is another column called total team used the **Poker Planning** method to assigned overall story points based on the team’s collective thoughts/opinions.
* For the next sprint, the team plans to continue with the weekly meetings as this was decided by the team to act as a group discussion regarding the progression of the project. These meetings will be different from the standup meetings as there will be more chances for members to express any difficulties/concerns they may have and serve as code review sessions before the end of the sprint .
