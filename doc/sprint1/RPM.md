# Release Planning Meeting

Team _FULL THROTTLE AXOLOTL_ is making a Course Planner web application to help UTM students plan out their academic career with ease.

The _Course Planner_ webapp is set to release its final version by April 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2020 and will be accomplished in 4 sprints starting from February 14<sup>th</sup>, 2020. By the end of each sprint, the _Course Planner_ will have significantly iterated its functionality and will aim to include the potential sprint goals outlined in this release plan:

**Sprint 1** (2020-02-14)
- A barebones example of what the website will look like from a technical standpoint
- A rough layout of how the features-to-be will be displayed

**Sprint 2** (2020-02-28)
- A fully navigable and technically operable website
- A functional database of example courses, schedules, tutorials, and other relevant info
- A user account registration and login system
- An information recording system that saves user data to their account for later access

**Sprint 3** (2020-03-13)
- A course prerequisite checking system that determines if a user account's recorded course data meets the conditions for enrolment in certain courses
- A calendar/timetable planner GUI that shows blocks of time dedicated to different events like weekly course times, course overload or underload for the semester, test and assignment dates, etc.
- A graduation planner that helps students visualize their academic career path from beginning to end

**Sprint 4** (2020-03-27)
- An alternative timetable planner that shows potential graduation paths a student could take if the one they set out to initially accomplish is no longer their desire
- An opt-in course comparator feature that allows users to search for other users in order to get a look at what their academic career path looks like
- An export feature that lets a user create a .ical file that can be imported by Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, iCalendar etc.
- Bug fixes, bonus feature round-up, and polish

***Release Day*** (2020-04-02)
- Final pass on existing features and functionality
- A finished _Course Planner_!

As all software development projects go, nothing ever goes according to the original plan. In case development veers off track or the team's overall design paradigm shifts during the process, these are the major release goals that ***must*** be hit by release day:

- **(S2)** A fully navigable and technically operable website
- **(S2)** A functional database of example courses, schedules, tutorials, and other relevant info
- **(S2)** A user account registration and login system
- **(S2)** An information recording system that saves user data to their account for later access
- **(S3)** A course prerequisite checking system that determines if a user account's recorded course data meets the conditions for enrolment in certain courses

- **(S3)** A graduation planner that helps students visualize their academic career path from beginning to end

These are the main features of the _Course Planner_ that define its purpose, the others are more for breadth of qualitative functionality, rather than quantitative.

The developers of Team *FTA* that have formulated and finalized these goals are:
