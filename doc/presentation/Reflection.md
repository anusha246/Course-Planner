## Tools/Techniques/Conventions

### What worked

- Weekly group meetings proved to be helpful
    - They often illuminated issues and considerations between devs’ work that would have otherwise gone unmentioned
- Discussed big feature designs in meetings to solve a difference of visions on a particular task or element
    - Ensured everyone was on the same page, was heard, and had a clear idea of what to do
- Individuals were given freedom on how they wanted certain small things to look
    - Thus, we did not waste time on deciding on small elements’ designs
- Good standup meeting descriptions
    - Helped us understand each other’s tasks
- Good communication between devs in the WhatsApp chat during development
    - Eliminated guesswork as to what was being done in the moment and what the rationales for the changes were
- Good branching practices and descriptive commit messages with task ticket numbers
    - Provided a clear understanding of what the commit changed
- Good handling of Jira tasks
    - Everyone knew what to do and how to move forward for the next sprints
- Divided tasks up further to handle things that required more than one person
    - Allowed us to collaborate more and finish big tasks
- Divided tasks to be independent of each other
    - That way we did not have to depend on someone else to finish something
- Everyone picked their own tasks and worked on tasks they were familiar with
    - Allowed them to finish them as soon as possible

### What didn’t

- [Codeshare.io](https://codeshare.io/) ultimately didn’t get used
    - Was not necessary for code comparing across devs’ independent work
- Trying to use Visual Studio Code instead of the recommended Eclipse IDE for Neo4j database operations
    - Proved to be more of a headache than it needed to be when there were existing instructions for how to do this in Eclipse
- A lack of communication on some big changes
    - The code of some previous features had to be updated, which wasted time
- Some more work was needed on balancing the workload 
    - This would have meant fewer planned features getting scrapped in the end

## Future Design of Team Process

In an ideal scenario, our roles would align to what we described in our presentation and we would each focus on tasks and tools we were familiar with:

Name            | Role(s)
----------------|-----------------------------------------------
Aaron Strasser  | Scrum Master; Backend Developer
Anusha Pahore   | Full Stack Developer
Azan Ghazi      | Full Stack Developer; Database Management
Gordon Monk     | Project Manager; Documentation Facilitator
Nabeel Rajabali | Full Stack Developer
Rohan Patil     | Full Stack Developer; User information management
Venura Perera   | Frontend Developer

The project began with each of us feeling unsure of exactly what kinds of contributions we’d be able to provide without a clear idea of the end product in mind, but once we got the ball rolling we could clearly identify what elements of the project fell within our respective skill sets and how we would define our roles.

In the future, we should continue all the practices that worked, while being more descriptive of what big changes we made and balancing our workloads better.
