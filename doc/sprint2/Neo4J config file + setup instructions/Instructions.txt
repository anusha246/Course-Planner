In your directory where you installed neo4j (used same community edition here that was used in a1),
copy paste the neo4j.conf file into the directory: "...neo4j_directory\conf"

Current port being used is located under "network connector coniguration" header
If needed, .conf can be opened in notepad

Ports:
Bolt: 7687
HTTP: 7474
HTTPS: 7473

In order to run, ensure port is open on your router and firewall on computer

Firewall (windows):
- Search for "windows firewall" (Control Panel\System and Security\Windows Defender Firewall)
- Advanced settings
- Inbound Rules (lefthand side)
- New Rule (righthand side)
- port
- next
- TCP
- Enter in ports mentioned above
- next
- allow the connection
- next
- allow all networks
- next
- give it a name (doesn't matter just for you to see later in case you want to close port)
- finish

Router (in case ^^ doesn't work):
- Enter router's IP address in web browser
    Windows - Open Start, click the Settings gear, click Network & Internet, click View your network properties, and view the address next to "Default gateway"
    Mac - Open the Apple menu, click System Preferences, click Network, click Advanced, click the TCP/IP tab, and look for the number to the right of "Router:"
- Enter username and password
- Find the port forwarding section (under Port Forwarding, Applications, Gaming, Virtual Servers, Firewall, Protected Setup, or advanced settings)
- TCP
- Inbound/start: enter ports mentioned
- Private/End: re-type port numbers here or highest port number
- Give name/description (doesn't matter)
- Enter computer's IP address (should be different number in same location as router IP mentioned above)
- Save/Apply settings

The config file I set up should take care of the rest. Can test with cell phone by entering in your computer's internet ip
(google "what's my ip" to find this out) followed by the http port number. This should take you to database page.
