## Practices to continue for next sprint
- We’ve been almost perfect with our standup meeting punctuality; keep it up
- Good communication between devs in the WhatsApp chat during development
- Good branching practices and branch naming
- Descriptive commit messages with the ticket number of the task
- Good handling of Jira tasks

## New practices for next sprint
- Perhaps try out [codeshare](https://codeshare.io/) for simultaneous code editing between multiple devs
- We could get a server going to host our website for remote access to our latest version

## Practices to stop for next sprint
- Not having Jira tasks setup for the upcoming sprint as a buffer caused some devs to wait idly for direction
- Need to stay on top of specifying when their Jira tasks have moved from “To Do” to “In Progress”
- Need to stay on top of posting standup meetings during the scheduled days

## Best/Worst experience for Sprint 2

### *Aaron Strasser*
**Best**: Starting to figure out what the final project will look like and cutting out unnecessary parts as we go along so we can meet our goals. Also finally getting the remote DB configuration up and running

**Worst**: Understandably, most of the group was busy over the reading week and this week due to midterms, a2, and other assignments. Time is short, but I know we will pull through in the end

### *Anusha Pahore*
**Best**: Getting the basic layout and view of the “My Account” page and presenting it for the demo.

**Worst**: I did not have much time to work on this Sprint due to having many assignments due this week.

### *Azan Ghazi*
**Best**: The DB and website are fully outlined now, and working on a surface level. We can now actively add our remaining features with all necessary tools, outlines, and prerequisites completed.

**Worst**: The barrage of assignments and midterms this sprint cycle left me with very little time. Progress was made in between work and study sessions for other assignments and midterms.  

### *Gordon Monk*
**Best**: Getting the Jira tasks set up for all devs to work and having a solid demo to present in time as a result was a relief.

**Worst**: Letting reading week get swept away by my other priorities set me back a bit for this coursework.

### *Nabeel Rajabali*
**Best**: Creating sketches for pages before implementing them helps everyone work towards a common product. Having Jira tasks helps us in determining how much work we’ve completed vs what needs to be done, as well as tasks that depend on each other or are related to each other.

**Worst**: Not spending reading week on the project due to deferred exams. Not planning before implementing. Having one person be in charge of the design and implementation of an entire page.

### *Rohan Patil*
**Best**: Completing the REST API setup and connecting it with the Javascript code for the website’s user login and registration

**Worst**: Not enough time to work on this sprint due to having other assignments as well as midterms to study for.

### *Venura Perera*
**Best**: Getting a task that is relatively easy to accommodate for my unavailability to work on the project due to other assignments/midterms/interviews

**Worst**: Letting reading week get wasted, as well as having a bunch of midterms and other assignments as well as internship hunting getting in the way for this sprint
