# Sprint 4

## Sprint Goal

- Finish remaining work on the major release goals outlined in [RPM.md from Sprint 1](https://github.com/UTMCSC301/project-full-throttle-axolotl/blob/master/doc/sprint1/RPM.md)

## Difficulty Spikes

- All devs had other final projects and term tests as main priorities this sprint which made coordinating dependent work efforts more difficult
- It should go without saying that the global state of emergency is a significant mental hurdle to blocck out when trying to focus on a project
