## Best/Worst experience for Sprint 4

### *Aaron Strasser*
**Best**: Finishing up the last couple of features and seeing different group members’ features interacting with one another as planned.

**Worst**: Covid-19 made this sprint significantly harder to keep up and stay organized for me, and I’m sure other group members as well. Hopefully this will be taken into account with our final presentation’s evaluation.

### *Anusha Pahore*
**Best**: Working on the CSS and look of the website.

**Worst**: Too many assignments for all of my courses.

### *Azan Ghazi*
**Best**: Was able to Crate the Graduation Tree. Learn and use CSS. And Create the full db. It was gratifying to get a fair amount of work done. And everything went as planned.

**Worst**: Massive amount of workload this week due to 4 different assignments aside from the project.

### *Gordon Monk*
**Best**: Testing out the near-final product with the final CSS stylings all done was very gratifying; it really showed just how much a good team can create something greater than the sum of its parts.

**Worst**: Having many things due on March 27th caused me to have to rush certain aspects of all my projects due this week, making the push to get the remaining tracking deliverables done a stressful crunch time.

### *Nabeel Rajabali*
**Best**: Having multiple applications we’ve developed and worked on come together to communicate with each other and form a complete web application.

**Worst**: Being pressed for time and of course the massive impact the pandemic has had on my academic life.

### *Rohan Patil*
**Best**: Completing CSS tasks for the final appearance of the website and completing User profile page.

**Worst**: Had too many assignments for other courses as well as A3 for CSC301.

### *Venura Perera*
**Best**: Finishing the final touches on the CSS and just on the project in general, as well as seeing everything work properly as planned and every aspect of the project coming together.

**Worst**: Too many assignments for other courses as well as an issue with neo4j which caused a roadblock in my progress.
