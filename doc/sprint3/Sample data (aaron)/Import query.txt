As of right now to import the data needed for my query in java to work, use the above file and this:
LOAD CSV FROM "file:///courses.csv" AS data CREATE (:Course {Code:data[0],Name:data[1],Year: data[2],Semester:data[3]})

To search in html, make sure you type in one of the course codes as shown in the file
e.g.
"csc369H5"

Make sure you have the database running, and the java application running to have it function correctly
