## Practices to continue for next sprint
- Especially amidst the pandemic panic, now is as good a time as any to continue the remote meetings we’ve migrated towards

## New practices for next sprint
- We may need to do live, multi-user code editing to connect all of the application’s features smoothly

## Practices to stop for next sprint
- In the interest of our health, the in-person meetings will halt and be replaced with remote meetings

## Best/Worst experience for Sprint 3

### *Aaron Strasser*
**Best**: Starting to see the project’s parts come together to complete a finished product

**Worst**: Realizing how much more work there still is to be done and how little time we have left. We may need to cut some of our initially planned features. Much of the tasks have been difficult so far, but this is a learning experience project and we will be better in the future.

### *Anusha Pahore*
**Best**: Finishing the Prerequisite Checker feature so that it returns all the courses needed to take a searched course.

**Worst**: Using JavaScript (which I do not know), HTML, and Java altogether was a time-consuming learning curve for me.

### *Azan Ghazi*
**Best**: All of the basic endpoints have been completed and the project is finally starting to connect with its front end and back end.

**Worst**: Very large assignments were due during the sprint which greatly limited the time to work on tasks. Some tasks needed to be stretched to sprint 4.

### *Gordon Monk*
**Best**: Seeing the functionality of the web application start to shine through the rough work that we’ve been toiling over is very rewarding.

**Worst**: Having to coordinate people amidst the pandemic scare in and out of this course has been chaotic to say the least.

### *Nabeel Rajabali*
**Best**: Understanding how Javascript can build an entire webpage from the frontend, styling and design, to the back end, functionality.

**Worst**: Struggling to learn a new language while piecing everyone’s work to work together with mine.

### *Rohan Patil*
**Best**: Completing user login and registration function and overcoming hurdle of CORS due to Java REST API and JavaScript compatibility issues.

**Worst**: Trying to find time to work in the sprint was difficult due to major CSC309 assignment which took most of the time in the sprint.

### *Venura Perera*
**Best**: Creating the sketch of what the graduation planner should look like, and then following the sketch completely accurately without any issues.

**Worst**: learning how to make tables and insert into tables using javascript, also learning how to use HTML, Javascript and CSS together in unity.
