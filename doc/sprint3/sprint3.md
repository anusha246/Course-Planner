# Sprint 3

## Sprint Goal

- A course prerequisite checking system that determines if a user account's recorded course data meets the conditions for enrolment in certain courses
- A calendar/timetable planner GUI that shows blocks of time dedicated to different events like weekly course times, course overload or underload for the semester, test and assignment dates, etc.
- A graduation planner that helps students visualize their academic career path from beginning to end

## Difficulty Spikes

- All devs had different priorities in the final month of this semester which made coordinating efforts a bit more difficult
- The pandemic panic has caused a push to limit human contact so in-person meetings were decentivized
